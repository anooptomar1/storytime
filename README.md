## About

### Single Sticker Mode

Pre-created stickers that you can print with the Brother sticker. They have SCN files associated and can be used as
a sticker. Once you place the sticker on a flat surface, navigate to the AR view and see what pops up.

### Create a Sticker

Take a picture and assign a 3d asset. Print and point the AR view and see some 3d model popup. 

### Story Mode

Not complete but the idea was to have the characters play out the story. Also be able to customize the story depending
on the sticker you put down. Other use of the story section is for teaching ABC for example and being able to customize
the character teaching the subject.

## Development

Some highlight about the project 

* Used new iOS 11.3 ARKit feature (at the entry time this was in beta and not released)
* Created some SCNs to setup an environment instead of just single object poping in and out.

## Disclaimer

Before you dive in to the code... This was a hackathon code! Supper hacky code with bunch of hard coded stuff
everywhere. The AR part of the code is probably the worst area of the code. Event then if you still want to see the
code or take the code, please feel free to do so.
